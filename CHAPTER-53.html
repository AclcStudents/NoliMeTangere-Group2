                        <BR><h1>Noli Me Tangere -Chapter 53</Br></h1>
                            <p>The young boy in Elías’s story runs away from his dead mother and brother, finally reaching a town where nobody knows of his family’s misfortune. There, he works hard for a rich man and saves money. During this time, he meets a young woman and falls in love. When the two try to marry, though, officials ask for his identification papers, and his past comes to light. His lover’s father—a wealthy man—takes him to trial and he is eventually sent to prison. Meanwhile, his lover gives birth to twins, whom her father raises secretly. One of these twins is Elías, and his grandfather—the rich man—tells him his father is dead. The twins live a good life full of many riches. </p>

<p>One day Elías insults a distant relative, who retaliates by revealing the truth about his family history. In fact, it appears Elías’s father has been working in his grandfather’s house as a servant for the boy’s entire childhood. The relative finds this out and makes it known, and Elías renounces his family inheritance. His grandfather dies out of shame, and his twin sister loses her fiancé to another woman. This same sister disappears one day, and Elías learns that she drowned in a nearby lake with a knife shoved into her chest. Since this discovery, he has been wandering the Philippines as people slander his name and fear him. </p>

<p>Having heard his friend’s story, Ibarra says he understands why Elías feels the way he does about corruption and criminality. But he also challenges Elías’s notion that “justice should seek goodness to recompense virtue and to reeducate criminals,” saying that this idea is “utopian” and unrealistic. He says that he refuses to be the leader of a rebellion, asserting that it is wrong to force change upon a government body. Rather, he wants to effect change through other means. “I want good for [my country],” he says, “which is why I built a school. I seek it in education, for forward progress. Without light, there is no path.” Elías replies by saying that “without struggle there is no freedom,” but Ibarra holds fast to his point of view. </p>
