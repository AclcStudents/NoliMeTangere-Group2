                            <p>	Taking Ibarra out in his boat, Elías explains the plight of Captain Pablo and his followers. This turns into a discussion about reform, one in which Elías advocates for a total upheaval of the government. Ibarra, on the other hand, argues for a tactic that seeks to bring about change by working within the already established systems of power. He points out that “weakening the Civil Guard would only endanger the people’s security,” but Elías says that the Civil Guard does little other than terrorize the very people it claims to protect. Ibarra admits that their country is flawed, but he voices his faith in the prevailing “institution.” In response, Elías says that the government makes criminals out of honest citizens by ruining their lives and forcing them resort to crime. </p>
                            <p>Ibarra and Elías’s political conversation continues. Elías succeeds somewhat in convincing Ibarra, but not completely. Rather, Ibarra decides to think these matters over more carefully before accepting to write to his influential friends in Madrid, who may be able to help improve the situation. Despite his agreement to think things over, though, he doubles down on his belief that the current institution benefits the Philippines, saying, “Have the Filipinos forgotten what they owe these orders? Have they forgotten the immense debt of gratitude they owe those who showed them the error of their ways and gave them faith […]?” He says that he thinks the friars are capable of helping the country, a statement that agitates Elías, who concludes that the reason Ibarra doesn’t understand is because he has never experienced true persecution. </p>

                            <p>Ibarra sees Elías’s frustration, acknowledging his friend’s “suffering” and utter discontent. Elías says that his misgivings about the country arise out of his personal experiences. “Perhaps knowing them will change my thoughts,” Ibarra says, encouraging his friend to tell him his life story in order to better express the origins of his views. </p>
