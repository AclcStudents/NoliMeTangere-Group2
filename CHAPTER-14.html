                            <P>The old man who asked the gravedigger about a skull now wanders the streets. His name is Tasio, and the townspeople either call him a madman or a philosopher depending on their opinion of him and his strange ways. He values rationalism and philosophy rather than religion, which is uncommon in town. Near the church, he comes upon the mayor and playfully chastises him for installing a new bell tower, saying that this extravagant addition to the church will surely attract lightning from the storm that is brewing. As he says this, a bolt flashes and the mayor crosses himself as Tasio laughs disapprovingly, critiquing the mayor’s frivolous use of money and his superstitious ways. </P>

                            <P>Leaving the mayor behind, Tasio passes two young boys who are studying to be sextons. He asks if they’re coming home with him, since he lives near their mother, who is expecting them for dinner. They tell him that the chief sexton won’t let them leave until eight o’clock and that they have to go up the tower to ring bells to commemorate souls trapped in purgatory. Tasio tells them to be careful and continues on his way.	</P>
                            <P>As Tasio walks the streets, a voice calls from a window and invites him inside. It’s Don Filipo, the deputy mayor and “almost liberal” party chief. Inside, Tasio, Filipo, and Filipo’s wife talk about Ibarra’s appearance in the graveyard that afternoon. Tasio tells them that he complained to the Captain General when he saw the “extraordinary profanation” brought about by the exhumation of Don Rafael’s body. This conversation leads to a discussion of purgatory, and Tasio makes clear that he doesn’t pay much attention to the notion of saving souls who languish between heaven and hell, giving his listeners a long history of how the idea of purgatory entered into Catholicism, though he doesn’t finish this lecture. Instead, he takes his leave, lamenting the fact that on this day—All Souls’ Day—“Christian piety permits robbery” that the government allows to happen. He flees into the night, lightning breaking across the sky. </P>
