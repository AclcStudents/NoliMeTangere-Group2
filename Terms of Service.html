                      <BR><h1><i>Noli Me Tangere</Br></h1></i>
<p>Crisostomo Ibarra was a young Filipino who studied with his father in Europe. After seven years there, it returned to the Philippines. As a result of his arrival, Captain Tiyago offered a gift which Padre Damaso, Padre Sibyla, Tinyente Guevarra, Donya Victorina and some high-ranking people, took over from the Castilian society. On that evening, Padre Damaso, who was a former curator of San Diego, was the young man, but he was not the only one who noticed and wished to inform and express his appreciation. </p>
 

<p>Ibarra was Maria Clara's wife. He is known as the son of Captain Tiyago, a wealthy Binundok citizen. The young man goes to the virgin in the future and in their marriage is unquestioned their domination from their youth. Maria Clara did not read the young man's letters to her again before she even went to study in Europe. Before Ibarra headed to San Diego, Tinyente Guevarra of the Guardia Civil briefed him about the death of his father, Don Rafael, the wealthy asunder in that village. </p>
 

<p>According to Tinyente, Don Rafael was named by Padre Damaso, the Erehe and Pilibustero, an act of unreasonable worship and corruption. This chapter adds one more event. Sometimes there was a tax collector who encountered a young student, Don Rafael saw it and helped the child, angered the clerk and they were the opponents, unfortunately the head of the castle fell on a stone that he killed. He witnessed this death of the clergyman to Don Rafael, persecuted him, struck his secret enemies and faced various challenges. He was detained and as soon as the case was resolved, the elderly fell ill and died in prison. Father Damaso was still unhappy with the event. He ordered the burial of Don Rafael's body at the cemetery where he was buried for the Catholics and elsewhere at the Chinese Cemetery, and because of the fall of the body and the damage, he was forced to throw it out of the lake. Ibarra did not plan to take revenge on Padre Damaso's commitment and instead continued his father's plan to build a school. </p>


<p>In the celebration of the laying of the first stone of the school, Ibarra would have been murdered if he had not been saved by Elijah. When Ibarra threw the stone while it was beaten, it wasn't Ibarrah who returned, but the man who was paid by the young man's secret enemy. 
In the sacrifice offered by Ibarra after the baptism, Father Damaso reinstated the young man, not only that he should have noted it, but as his father's memory grew, he did not stop and persuade the priest, thanks only and was prevented by Maria Clara. </p>


<p>Because of this incident, Ibarra was dismissed or excommunicated by the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church. It was prompted by Father Damaso to order Captain Tiyago to dissolve the agreement between Ibarra and Maria Clara. The priest wishes that the virgin's wife be Linares, a young man from the castle who was new to the Philippines. </p>


<p>As a result of the stoning stone on the day of the celebration, Maria Clara fell sick and blew. Because of Ibarra's prescribed medicine, he was also drunk by Sinang who healed the maiden immediately. </p>


<p>With the help of the Captain-General, Ibarra's excommunication was dismissed and the archbishop ordered him to be re-admitted to the Catholic Church. But Ibarra was the only person who had been arrested by the civilian quarters and the one who was arrested with the ability, so he was captured and imprisoned. The young man had nothing to do with this, because when Elijah asked him to lead the oppressors, he clearly refused and said he could never be the leader of those who represented the people. </p>


<p>Ibarra's star was destroyed because no one could say that he was satisfied with the tragedy. But the letter he wrote to Maria Clara, who had been sentenced to prison, made him an agent so that he could be destroyed. </p>

<p>There was a memorial at Captain Tiyago's house to declare the agreement on Maria Clara's extradition to Linares and while this was taking place, Ibarra escaped from prison with Elias' help. </p>


<p>Before they escaped, Ibarrang had a chance to uncover the secrets of Maria Clara. She was given her freedom here and she should be happy and her will be silent. Maria Clara explained that the letter she kept and she used in court was obtained from her by interrogation. In these letters he exchanged two letters written by his mother before he was born, which Padre Salvi obtained in the conclave and here it is stated that his real father was Padre Damaso. </p>


<p>He told Ibarra that he would therefore deal with Linares to defend his mother's honor but his love for young people would never change. </p>


<p>Meanwhile, Ibarra escaped with the help of Elijah. They climbed the boat, laid Ibarra down and covered her with grass and then rushed the Pasig River until it reached Lake of the Bay. But they were struck by those who rebelled against them. Elijah thought he was gonna break them, so he thought he would descend into the water where Ibarra was supposed to descend, so the civilians threw him down and choked him until the thunderstorm was wiped out and the water became dull. </p>


<p>Maria Clara learned that Ibarra was killed by the civilians in her exile. The maid was upset and lost hope, so she asked Father Damaso to bring her into the Santa Clara convent to marry. The couple were forced to reveal because the maiden said that she would kill when she was not taught. 
When Elijah arrived in the woods of the Ibarra, he was wounded and saddened that he found Basilio and his mother dead. </p>


<p>Before he heard the sound was said, died he could not see the consolation of his people and will never forget those who died because of the defense of the woods. </p>

<B><I><p>Reflection</I></B>:
  I have learned that the noli me tangere is about the real life of Rizal and it is also about the oppression of the castela to the Filipino people like Rizal who fought the castle. They are also the ones who made the loved ones of my life happy because so Rizal pushed the Filipinos against castles using the novel Noli Me Tangere. </p>
