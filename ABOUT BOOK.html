                    <p>“Noli Me Tangere” is a significant novel in Philippine literature and history. Written by the national hero, Dr. José Rizal, it was first published in 1887 in Germany. The title, “Noli Me Tangere,” is Latin for “Touch Me Not,” which is a reference to a biblical verse.
                    The novel is set during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines and provides a detailed depiction of the society at that time. It exposes the inequities in law and practice in terms of the treatment by the ruling government and the Spanish Catholic friars of the resident peoples in the late-19th century.
                    The story revolves around the character of Don Crisóstomo Ibarra, a young man of Filipino and Spanish descent who returns to the Philippines after a seven-year trip to Europe. Other major characters include María Clara, Kapitán Tiyago, Padre Damaso, Elias, Pilosopo Tasyo, Doña Victorina, and Sisa.
                    “Noli Me Tangere” has had a profound influence on Filipino nationalism and is considered the national epic of the Philippines. The Rizal Law requires “Noli Me Tangere” and its sequel, “El Filibusterismo,” to be read by all high school students throughout the country.
                    The novel has been translated into various languages and has been adapted into many forms, such as operas, musicals, plays, and other forms of art. It continues to be a source of inspiration and a symbol of the Filipino struggle for independence and national identity.</p>
