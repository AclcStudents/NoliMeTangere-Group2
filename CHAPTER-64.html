                        <BR><h1>Noli Me Tangere -Chapter 64</Br></h1>
                            <p>	As for Captain Tiago, he is happy and relieved to see that nobody pays him much attention during these turbulent times. Unlike many of his friends—whom the Captain General orders to live in government buildings for several days—he is permitted to remain in his home. While his acquaintances undergo close investigations, he is left alone. Rumors circulate that Ibarra will be hanged. The de Espadañas return to visit Tiago again, and Doña Victorina has adopted a new way of speaking, an imitation of a southern Spanish person’s lisp—she takes this affectation so far that it’s difficult to understand what she’s saying. </p>
<p>While Doña Victorina and Captain Tiago discuss plans for María Clara and Linares’s wedding, Aunt Isabel comforts her niece, telling her that marrying Linares will grant her all kinds of privileges. “Everyone will envy us, they’ll die of envy!” she says. The next night, Tiago hosts a party, where the ensign brags about the battle, portraying himself as a great hero. Indeed, he has been promoted to a commanding lieutenant. Turning his attention to Father Salví, the ensign says that he’s heard the priest is leaving San Diego. Salví acknowledges this, saying there’s nothing left for him in this town. The ensign then brags that he too is leaving because the government has called upon him to eradicate subversion in other provinces. </p>

<p>Overhearing a conversation about Ibarra’s fate, the lieutenant Señor Guevara angrily juts in, saying that it is only because Ibarra trusted the wrong people that he landed in such unfavorable and compromising circumstances. He casts a stern gaze at Father Salví, who turns away. Hearing this, María Clara drops the flowers she’s holding and goes perfectly still. Guevara continues by saying that the defense attorney in Ibarra’s case told him that “apart from several ambiguous lines [Ibarra] wrote to a woman before leaving for Spain, lines in which the prosecutor saw the planning and a threat against the government, and which he acknowledged were his, they couldn’t accuse him of anything.” </p>

<p>One of the people speaking with Señor Guevara brings up the point that one of the bandits said Ibarra was the ringleader of the rebels. Guevara dismisses this, saying that the defense attorney later “negated all that” since at a different time the same bandit said he only ever spoke to Lucas. And since Lucas was an old enemy of Ibarra’s, Guevara argues, it’s obvious Ibarra was framed. One of the people listening to Guevara asks him about the incriminating letter, wondering how it made its way into the hands of the prosecutors in court. At this, Guevara falls silent and looks meaningfully at Father Salví before leaving. </p>

<p>On his way out, Señor Guevara stoops to whisper to María Clara, who has been listening to his conversation about Ibarra. “You did well to give them the letter,” he says, “it will assure you a peaceful future.” When he’s gone, María Clara retreats to her room, feeling ill and curling up on the floor, where she says “Mother, Mother, Mother!” over and over. </p>

<p>Finally the party ends and the house goes quiet. María Clara opens her eyes and walks onto her private patio. Perched against the railing, she sees a boat docking below. A man emerges and climbs up the patio, and she sees that it is Ibarra. Elías has freed him from prison and now he’s come to say goodbye. Before he leaves, though, María Clara tries to explain why she parted with his letter—which was used to find him guilty in court—but he isn’t interested in listening. Still, she persists, saying: “You hate me and your hatred will embitter me until I die.” Insisting that she’ll always love him, she explains, “On one of the painful nights of my suffering, a man revealed the name of my real father to me and then forbade my love for you…unless my real father would forgive the injury you have done to him.” </p>

<p>	As Elías rows Ibarra to safety after stopping at María Clara’s house, he suggests a plan: he will hide Ibarra at a friend’s house in another town while he goes to Ibarra’s grandfather’s tomb, where he has hidden Ibarra’s money. He’ll then help Ibarra leave the country, safely transporting him to Spain where he can live free of danger. As thanks for everything he’s done, Ibarra invites Elías to come live with him abroad, but Elías declines, saying, “It’s true I can neither love my country nor be happy here, but I can suffer and die in it, and for it.” When Ibarra asks why, then, Elías is telling him to leave, Elías says, “Because you can be happy elsewhere, but I can’t […].” This insults Ibarra, who suddenly decides he wants to stay in the Philippines to fight for his country. </p>

<p>As they row on the lake, Elías points out that Ibarra’s newfound will to fight contrasts his earlier reluctance to support revolution. Ibarra argues that this is because he can now see “the horrible cancer gnawing at this society.” Now that he has experienced the worst his country has to offer, he accepts the title of a “subversive.” “They opened my eyes, they made me see the sores and forced me to become a criminal! And so, just what they wanted, I will be a subversive, but a true subversive,” he declares. He then corrects himself, saying that he won’t actually be a true criminal, since a person isn’t a criminal if he’s fighting for the good of his country. In contrast, Elías is apprehensive, warning Ibarra that his attitude is liable to start a war. “I will never accede to those measures as long as I see men hope,” he says. </p>

<p>As Ibarra and Elías debate, a boat of Civil Guard members starts chasing them. Ibarra ducks beneath bales of hay, and Elías tries to out-row the Civil Guard, but it’s clear they’ll catch up. “Do you know how to handle a boat?” he asks Ibarra, telling him that he’ll jump into the water so the Civil Guard members will follow him, thinking he’s Ibarra. The real Ibarra will then row to shore. Bullets skim the water around them, and just before Elías dives overboard, he tells Ibarra to meet him on Christmas Eve at his grandfather’s tomb in the woods. Then Elías dives and, as expected, the Civil Guard follows him, shooting all the while. He plunges deep and swims for long periods of time, only surfacing occasionally for air in a sporadic pattern. After a half hour, the guards don’t see him resurface, and they even think they see hues of blood in the water. </p>

<p>	Guests stack wedding gifts on a table in Captain Tiago’s house, but María Clara is uninterested in anything other than the newspaper she holds, which reports that Ibarra has drowned in the lake. Father Dámaso comes up behind her and surprises her, but upon seeing her hesitancy to greet him, he asks what’s wrong. As he sits to hear what she has to say, she weeps, and he asks if she’s had a fight with Linares. “Don’t talk to me of him…now!” she replies. She then asks if he still loves her, saying that if he does, he’ll put an end to this arranged marriage. She explains that she felt able to move forward with the wedding only because she thought Ibarra was still alive—knowing that was the only thing keeping her going. Now, with nothing left to live for, she can’t bear the thought of marrying Linares. </p>
<p>María Clara tells Father Dámaso that, now that Ibarra has died, she has only two options: “the convent or the grave.” Seeing her intense unhappiness, Father Dámaso says the only reason he interfered with her engagement to Ibarra is because he wanted what was best for her. He reminds her that if she had married Ibarra, she would now be a disgraced woman doomed to a life of isolation. He then turns his attention to the convent, saying, “I would rather a thousand times see you unhappy in the world than in a cloister…” She reiterates her views, telling him she will either die or become a nun. Covering his head with his hands, he yells, “You can punish me, Lord, but the veil for my child…” Before leaving, he finally agrees to let her enter the convent. </p>

	<p>On Christmas Eve, the young Basilio sits outside a cottage in the woods and watches two children play. They are his informal adoptive siblings, but he doesn’t partake in their games. Rather, he tells the household’s grandfather—who found him passed out and injured in the woods two months before—that he needs to go into town to look for his mother. Reluctantly, the old man lets him go, and Basilio limps his way through the woods and into San Diego, where Captain Basilio speaks with Don Filipo in the street, telling him he’s lucky to have been let go unharmed by the Civil Guard, who merely burned his books. In this moment, Sisa runs by, still out of her mind. The young Basilio follows his mother’s singing, but she doesn’t recognize him. </p>

<p>Trailing Sisa, Basilio finds himself entering the woods. Sisa runs into a thicket and enters a wooden gate that blocks off the tomb of Ibarra’s grandfather. When he himself arrives at the gate, she refuses to let him in. He pounds against it, saying, “Mother, it’s me, it’s me, it’s Basilio, your son!” When this fails, he climbs a tree, drops down on the other side of the fence, and keeps his mother from running away by hugging and kissing her. He then passes out, at which point Sisa sees she is holding her son. When he eventually wakes up, he discovers that now it is Sisa who is unconscious, and he’s unable to wake her. Putting his ear to her heart, he hears no pulse. </p>


<p>At that moment, a wounded man appears and drops to the ground. He asks Basilio if he’s seen anybody else at the tomb. He then asks what the boy is going to do with his dead mother. When Basilio fails to propose a plan, the man instructs him, telling him to fetch firewood to build a pyre. Explaining that he himself is about die, the man asks Basilio to put his and Sisa’s body on the pyre before lighting it. “Then,” he says, “if no one else comes…dig here, and you will find a great deal of gold…and it will all be yours.” As Basilio scrambles off to get the wood to build the pyre, the man faces east and whispers, “I die without seeing dawn’s light shining on my country…You, who will see it, welcome it for me…don’t forget those who fell during the nighttime.” </p>
