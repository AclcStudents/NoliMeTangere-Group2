                        <BR><h1>Noli Me Tangere -Chapter 22</Br></h1>
                            <p>For the next three days, the town prepares for the fiesta. María Clara arrives with Aunt Isabel, and the townspeople notice a profound difference in Father Salví, who seems distracted during his sermons and becomes thinner. Even more notably, he stays out late at night while visiting María Clara’s house. As for Ibarra, nobody knows why he’s absent, and some speculate that he has been imprisoned for having forced Father Salví to his knees on All Saints’ Day. These suspicions are dispelled, though, when he arrives in front of María Clara’s house in San Diego and warmly greets Father Salví, who is also on his way to pay the young woman a visit. </p>

                            <p>In an intimate conversation, Ibarra and María Clara plan an outing with friends the next day. María Clara pleads with Ibarra to not let Father Salví come, because he’s always watching her with “sad, sunken eyes” that unnerve her. “He once asked me if I had dreamed about letters from my mother,” she says. “I think he’s half crazy.” Ibarra says that, because of the town’s customs, it is impossible to not invite Father Salví. However, he decides the party will be organized around a boat trip that will leave early in the morning, so that Father Salví will have to decline in order to fulfill his priestly duties in the first half of the day. This plan works, though Salví is so disappointed to miss out on spending time with María Clara that he promises to meet up with them later in the day, after they’ve finished their boating. </p>
                            
                            
                            <p>As Ibarra leaves María Clara’s house that evening, a stranger comes upon him in the street and tells him he’s been waiting to speak with him. He explains that nobody will help him because everybody thinks he’s a thief, but he has recently lost both his sons and his wife has gone crazy. He implores Ibarra to “have pity” on him and his family, and though Ibarra says he doesn’t have much time, he invites the man to walk with him and tell him what has happened. </p>
