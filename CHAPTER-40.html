                        <BR><h1>Noli Me Tangere -Chapter 40</Br></h1>
                            
                            <p>At the theater that night, Don Filipo tells Tasio that the mayor hasn’t accepted his resignation, instead suggesting that they postpone discussing the matter until after the festival. When the performance starts, Father Salví stares at María Clara with his sunken eyes. At a certain point, the priest approaches Don Filipo and implores him to eject Ibarra from the premises, but Filipo says there is no reason to do so—Ibarra isn’t disrupting the peace. As a result, all of the priests leave. Just as Filipo is turning his attention back to the entertainment, two members of the Civil Guard approach him and ask him to stop the performance because the ensign and his wife “have had a fistfight and can’t sleep.” Don Filipo refuses to do so, saying that this event has been approved by the mayor. He then turns his back on the soldiers, who leave. </p>

                            <p>Suddenly, in the middle of the performance, people start shouting, “Bandits! Bandits” and, “Fire! Fire! Thieves!” because two Civil Guards have attacked the musicians in the orchestra in order to stop the event. As Don Filipo and his men quell the soldiers, the crowd curses the Civil Guard, proposing to burn the military barracks. Don Filipo begs Ibarra to help him dissuade the masses from this violent idea. Seeing Elías in the crowd, Ibarra asks if there’s anything he can do, and Elías bounds into the mob to try. </p>
                            
                            <p>Watching this chaotic scene, Father Salví thinks he sees Ibarra pick up María Clara and run away with her. Because he can’t stand the idea that this might lead to some sort of sexual act, he sets off in the same direction, running through the danger. When he reaches María Clara’s house, though, he sees her on the terrace with Aunt Isabel, who is tending to the young girl because she has—evidently—fallen ill. On his way back, he fantasizes about her sleeping body and many other salacious images. Rizal then includes a newspaper correspondent’s summary of the hectic night, which gives “a thousand thanks” to “the opportune and active intervention” of Father Salví, who the correspondent claims rushed into the crowd despite the danger and brought peace to the streets using only his words. </p>
