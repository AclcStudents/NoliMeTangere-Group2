                            <p>In a cave set deep in the forest, Elías meets with a haggard old man named Captain Pablo. Pablo has with him a band of armed men with dirt on their skin and torn clothing. Elías is sorry to see that this friend of his is living in such unfortunate circumstances and tells him that he’s planning to travel north to live “among the free, pagan tribes.” He invites Pablo to come along. “I’ll be your son, since you’ve lost your own, and I, who have no family, will find a father in you.” </p>
<p>Captain Pablo refuses Elías’s offer, saying that he is like a “tree shorn of its limbs,” destined to be a fugitive. He briefly recounts his story, saying that a minister raped his daughter. Because the minister feared that Pablo’s two sons would take revenge, he framed one of them as a robber and tortured him to death. The other son was arrested by the Civil Guard for not carrying identity papers and treated so badly that he committed suicide. Now, Pablo explains, he has assembled a number of similarly disempowered and abused citizens who are seeking revenge. Elías points out that the rebellion Pablo proposes will have adverse effects on innocent townspeople, since the church and government will respond by harming their own citizens. </p>

<p>Elías tries to dissuade Pablo from launching a rebellion by telling him about Ibarra, whom he thinks he can convince to represent the disaffected people that the current systems of power have treated so poorly. He suggests that perhaps Ibarra can speak with the Captain General about these difficult matters. Although Pablo appears unconvinced, Elías persuades him to at least refrain from launching a bloody campaign until Ibarra has heard their case. He tells him to send somebody to the beach in San Diego in four days to learn whether or not Ibarra has agreed to help. </p>
